  title: "Understanding Compound Interest",
  description: `Compound interest is often called the "eighth wonder of the world" because of its remarkable ability to grow money exponentially over time. Unlike simple interest, which only earns interest on the principal amount, compound interest earns interest on both the principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods.`,
  formula: "A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)",
  formulaExplanation: "where A is the final amount, P is the principal, r is the interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years."
